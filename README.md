# 📄 RAG Document Question Answering System

A production-ready **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that allows users to upload multiple PDF documents and ask natural language questions. The system intelligently retrieves relevant context and generates accurate, grounded answers using a HuggingFace language model.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Reading through large PDF documents to find specific information is slow and inefficient. This system lets you upload any PDF — a textbook, research paper, medical document, or legal contract — and ask questions in plain English. The system finds the relevant context and answers instantly.

## 💡 How to Use

1. Click **Browse files** and upload one or more PDF documents
2. Wait for the system to process and index the documents
3. Type your question in the text box
4. The system retrieves relevant chunks and generates an answer
5. Scroll down to see the source document chunks used

---

## 🧪 Example Questions to Try

Using the included demo PDFs:

- *"What is Artificial Intelligence?"*
- *"What is Machine Learning?"*
- *"What is Natural Language Processing?"*
- *"What is Deep Learning?"*
- *"What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?"*
- *"What are the uses of Paracetamol?"*

## 🔍 How RAG Works — Simple Explanation

Traditional language models answer from memory (training data). RAG is different:

1. **Retrieve** — find the most relevant parts of YOUR documents
2. **Augment** — add that context to the question
3. **Generate** — LLM answers based on YOUR documents, not general knowledge

This means the model answers from your actual documents — reducing hallucination and giving accurate, grounded responses.

## 📊 Key Technical Decisions

**Why all-MiniLM-L6-v2?**
Lightweight (80MB), fast inference, strong semantic similarity performance. Ideal for local deployment without GPU.

**Why FAISS?**
Facebook's FAISS library performs approximate nearest neighbour search in milliseconds even on millions of vectors. No external server needed — runs entirely in memory.

**Why chunk_overlap=100?**
Prevents answers from being missed when they span chunk boundaries. The 100-character overlap ensures context continuity between adjacent chunks.

**Why k=3 retrieval?**
Balances context richness with prompt length. Three chunks provide enough context for most questions without overwhelming the LLM's input capacity.

**Why text2text-generation pipeline?**
flan-t5-base is a sequence-to-sequence model designed for text2text-generation tasks. Using this pipeline type ensures the model returns only the generated answer — not the full prompt template.

## 🚀 Possible Improvements

- [ ] Persist FAISS index to disk to avoid re-indexing on every run
- [ ] Upgrade LLM to `flan-t5-large` or API-based model for better answer quality
- [ ] Add support for `.txt` and `.docx` file formats
- [ ] Add conversation memory for follow-up questions
- [ ] Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud for public access
